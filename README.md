The assembler is a linux mint virtual machine created by the instructor for this class. <br>
In this first lab we just installed the assembler using virtual box.

### Lab2 (Displaying Output)

We wrote a basic "Hello World" command (Although in assembly it's no so basic). <br>
We also briefly took a user input.

GDB is an assembly de bugging tool. <br>
In this lab we used code given to us and looked through it using GDB to learn the commands and what it can do.

This lab is to learn more indepth how to take user input and how to add and subract. <br>
we took user input of two numbers then converted them from strings to integers, We then added and substracted them and displayed them to the users.
