# Github Repo For UNK's Cyber 301 Assembly Code

## X86 Assembly

### Lab1 (Setting up the assembler)
The assembler is a linux mint virtual machine created by the instructor for this class. <br>
In this first lab we just installed the assembler using virtual box.

### Lab2 (Displaying Output)
In this second lab we wrote our first assemblt code. <br>
We wrote a basic "Hello World" command (Although in assembly it's no so basic). <br>
We also briefly took a user input.

### Lab3 (Learning GDB)
GDB is an assembly de bugging tool. <br>
In this lab we used code given to us and looked through it using GDB to learn the commands and what it can do.

### Lab4 (User input)
This lab is to learn more indepth how to take user input and how to add and subract. <br>
we took user input of two numbers then converted them from strings to integers, We then added and substracted them and displayed them to the users.

### Calc (Calculator)
A calculator that I built on my own to practice. Not very advanced and can't do division.

### Lab 5 (Loops & Lables)
This lab we used labels and jump calls to make loops.
We make acumulating loops counting or adding for each iteration of the loop.

### HW2 (Calculator like program)
A homework assignment that uses all previously learned concepts to build a program similar to a calculator.

### Lab 6 (Arrays)
This lab we made arrays. We corrected the address to find the address of other array items.

### Lab 7 (Min Max)
Wrote a program that find the minimum and maximum number from the user inputed numbers.

### Final (Two player fighting game)
My final project for computer organization. We were allowed to build anything we wanted so long as it adequately used the conepts learned this semester <br>
It is a two player fighting game built in x86 assembly.
